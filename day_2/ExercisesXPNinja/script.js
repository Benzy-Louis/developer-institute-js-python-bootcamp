// Exercise 1: Evaluation
/*
For each expression, predict what you think the output will be in a comment (//) without first running the command.
Of course, explain each prediction.
Then run the expression in the console. Note the actual output in a comment and compare it with your prediction.
*/

console.log(5 >= 1) // true: 5 is greater than 1
console.log(0 === 1) // false: the value of the number 0 is not the same as 1
console.log(4 <= 1) // false: 4 is not less than 1
console.log(1 != 1) // false: 1 is equal to 1  
console.log("A" > "B") // false: ASCII Number value of "A" is less than "B"
console.log("B" < "C") // true: ASCII Number value of "A" is less than "B"
console.log("a" > "A") // true: since the ASCII Number value of the lowercase chars is greater than the uppercase value of the char
console.log("b" < "A") // false: since the ASCII Number value of the lowercase chars is greater than the uppercase value of the char
console.log(true === false) // false: Only the value doesn't match
console.log(true != true) // false: In principle true cannot be not equal to true for example.
