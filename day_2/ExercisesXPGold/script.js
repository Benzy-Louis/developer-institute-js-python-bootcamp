// Exercise 1
let sentence = ["my", "favorite", "color", "is", "blue"];
console.log(sentence.join(" "));
// let str1 = "mix";
// let str2 = "pod";


// Slice out and swap the first 2 characters of the two strings from part 1.


// Create a third variable where the value is the concatenation of the two strings from the part 1 (separated by a space).


// Finally console.log the new concatenated string.
