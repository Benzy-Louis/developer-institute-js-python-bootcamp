Exercise 2 : Zip Codes
Instruction
Harder exercise
Hint : This exercise has 2 parts. First, do this exercise without Regular Expressions, then do it using Regular Expressions

While working in a Post Office you must have the clientsâ€™ zip code in order to send them their letters.
Ask the client for their zip code and console.log "success" or "error" based on the following rules.
Zip codes consists of 5 numbers
Must only contain numbers
Must not contain any whitespace (spaces)
Must not be greater than 5 digits in length
*/

// Without regular expressions

let zipCode = prompt("Input a zip code please");
// let zipCode;
// zipCode = NaN;
// zipCode = "0  00";
// zipCode = "10451";
console.log("Without regex - Part I\n")
// We check the length of the string array and see if it's 5 
if (zipCode.length === 5) {
    // We check if each parsing the value to a number works if that is the case then it's a valid zip code else it isn't
    zipCode = Number(zipCode);
    // console.log(typeof (zipCode))
    console.log(zipCode);
    if (!(isNaN(zipCode))) {
        console.log("success");
    } else {
        console.log("error");
    }
} else {
    console.log("error");
}

console.log("\nUsing regex - Part II\n")
const regex5Digits = /\b\d{5}\b/;

if (regex5Digits.test(zipCode)) {
    console.log("success");
} else {
    console.log("error");
}
