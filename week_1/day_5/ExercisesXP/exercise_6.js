Exercise 6 : Vacations Costs
Instructions
Let's create functions that calculate your vacation's costs:

1. Define a function called hotelCost().
    - It should ask the user for the number of nights they would like to stay in the hotel.
    - If the user doesn't answer or if the answer is not a number, ask again.
    - The hotel costs $140 per night. The function should return the total price of the hotel.

2. Define a function called planeRideCost().
    - It should ask the user for their destination.
    - If the user doesn't answer or if the answer is not a string, ask again.
    - The function should return a different price depending on the location.
        - "London": 183$
        - "Paris" : 220$
        - All other destination : 300$

3. Define a function called rentalCarCost().
    - It should ask the user for the number of days they would like to rent the car.
    - If the user doesn't answer or if the answer is not a number, ask again.
    - Calculate the cost to rent the car. The car costs $40 everyday.
    - If the user rents a car for more than 10 days, they get a 5% discount.
    - The function should return the total price of the car rental.

4. Define a function called totalVacationCost() that returns the total cost of the user's vacation by calling the 3 functions that you created above.
Example : The car cost: $x, the hotel cost: $y, the plane tickets cost: $z.
Hint: You have to call the functions hotelCost(), planeRideCost() and rentalCarCost() inside the function totalVacationCost().

5. Call the function totalVacationCost()

6. Bonus: Instead of using a prompt inside the 3 first functions, only use a prompt inside the totalVacationCost() function. You need to change the 3 first functions, accordingly.
